# This is an example configuration file for spacenavd. Uncomment and change
# any settings you need and copy it to /etc/spnavrc.

# Note that it's much easier to configure sensitivities and figure out axis
# reversals by using the interactive configure utility "spnavcfg", which lets
# you fiddle with all the settings and see the result immediately.

# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, without the leading XK_

# fixed off-center position (like bottomed out on the vertical axis).
